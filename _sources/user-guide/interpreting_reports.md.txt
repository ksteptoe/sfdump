# Interpreting Reports

How to read and understand the export reports generated by sfdump.

## Report Overview

After running `sf dump` and generating a report, you'll have a document that summarizes your export. This guide explains what each section means.

## Executive Summary

The top of the report shows key numbers:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Total Attachments** | Legacy files found in Salesforce |
| **Total Documents** | Modern files (ContentVersion) found |
| **Downloaded** | Files successfully saved locally |
| **Missing** | Files that couldn't be downloaded |
| **Recovered** | Files recovered during retry |
| **Unrecoverable** | Files that no longer exist |

**Example:**
```
Export Summary
==============
Total Files:     12,847
Downloaded:      12,845 (99.98%)
Missing:              2 (0.02%)
```

### What the Numbers Mean

- **99-100% downloaded** — Excellent. Export is complete or nearly complete.
- **95-99% downloaded** — Good. A few files may have been deleted from Salesforce.
- **Below 95%** — Review the missing files. May need to re-run `sf dump`.

## Missing Files Section

Lists each file that couldn't be downloaded:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **File ID** | Salesforce ID (or `[REDACTED]` in redacted reports) |
| **Filename** | Original filename (or `[REDACTED]`) |
| **Parent Record** | What record the file was attached to |
| **Retry Status** | Whether recovery was attempted |
| **Error** | Why it failed |

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `404 Not Found` | File deleted from Salesforce | None — file no longer exists |
| `403 Forbidden` | No permission to access | Contact Salesforce admin |
| `Connection timeout` | Network issue during download | Run `sf dump` again |
| `Zero bytes received` | API returned empty file | Run `sf dump` again |

## Impact by Record Type

Shows which business records are affected by missing files:

```
Missing Files by Record Type
============================
Opportunity:           1 file
Account:               0 files
Invoice:               1 file
```

This helps you understand the business impact:
- Missing Opportunity files might affect deal history
- Missing Invoice files might affect financial records
- Missing Account files might affect customer documentation

## Redacted vs Full Reports

### Redacted Reports

Safe for external sharing. Sensitive information is hidden:

```
File: [REDACTED]
Parent: [REDACTED]
ID: ATTACHMENT_001
```

Use redacted reports for:
- Sharing with auditors
- Including in documentation
- Committing to repositories

### Full Reports

Contains actual Salesforce IDs and filenames:

```
File: Contract_AcmeCorp_2024.pdf
Parent: 0064J00000ABC123 (Opportunity)
ID: 00P4J00000XYZ789
```

Use full reports for:
- Internal IT review
- Troubleshooting specific files
- Salesforce admin investigation

**Never share full reports externally.**

## Reading the Recommendations

Reports end with actionable recommendations:

### "Export Complete"

```
Status: COMPLETE
All files downloaded successfully. No action required.
```

Your export is done. Archive it safely.

### "Nearly Complete"

```
Status: NEARLY COMPLETE
2 files could not be retrieved. These may have been deleted from Salesforce.
Recommendation: Review missing files list. If acceptable, archive the export.
```

A few files are missing but this is often normal — files get deleted over time.

### "Incomplete"

```
Status: INCOMPLETE
847 files could not be downloaded.
Recommendation: Run 'sf dump' again to retry failed downloads.
```

Significant files are missing. Re-run the export to recover them.
